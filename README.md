Maze Game!


Game Description:

In the beginning, the game will allow you to pick how many players wish to compete in the “Great Maze Games!” From there, the players will take turns, trying to maneuver their character through a maze. There will be a timer, calculating how long it takes each player to complete the maze. After each round, the program will scan to see who completed the maze fastest. A point will be rewarded to that player. The game will continue this style of competition through multiple rounds and announce the overall winner at the end of the game.
